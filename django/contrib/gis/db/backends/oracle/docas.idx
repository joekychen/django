f | base.py | s | 658B | 11 | Justin Bronn | jbronn@gmail.com | 1263848567 |  | Fixed #12637 -- GeoDjango's `inspectdb` command is now a subclass of Django's, and works with all spatial backends (Oracle and SpatiaLite did work before).  This changeset introduces new introspection modules for all of the spatial backends and adds hooks to the original `inspectdb.Command` class to enable reuse.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@12257 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
