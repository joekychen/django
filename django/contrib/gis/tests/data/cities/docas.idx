f | cities.prj | g | 143B |  | Justin Bronn | jbronn@gmail.com | 1238433349 |  | Refactored and cleaned up parts of the spatial database backend.  Changes include:  * Laid foundations for SpatiaLite support in `GeoQuerySet`, `GeoWhereNode` and the tests. * Added the `Collect` aggregate for PostGIS (still needs tests). * Oracle now goes to 11. * The backend-specific `SpatialRefSys` and `GeometryColumns` models are now attributes of `SpatialBackend`. * Renamed `GeometryField` attributes to be public that were private (e.g., `_srid` -> `srid` and `_geom` -> `geom_type`). * Renamed `create_test_db` to `create_test_spatial_db`. * Removed the legacy classes `GeoMixin` and `GeoQ`. * Removed evil `\` from spatial backend fields. * Moved shapefile data from `tests/layermap` to `tests/data`.  Fixed #9794.  Refs #9686.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10197 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
