Also added Atom support, changed the way feeds are registered and added documentation for the whole lot. This is backwards-incompatible, but the RSS framework had not yet been documented, so this should only affect tinkerers and WorldOnline. Fixes #329, #498, #502 and #554. Thanks for various patches/ideas to alastair, ismael, hugo, eric moritz and garthk  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@1194 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
