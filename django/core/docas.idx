f | signals.py | s | 150B | 4 | Jacob Kaplan-Moss | jacob@jacobian.org | 1218036766 |  | Major refactoring of django.dispatch with an eye towards speed. The net result is that signals are up to 90% faster.  Though some attempts and backwards-compatibility were made, speed trumped compatibility. Thus, as usual, check BackwardsIncompatibleChanges for the complete list of backwards-incompatible changes.  Thanks to Jeremy Dunck and Keith Busell for the bulk of the work; some ideas from Brian Herring's previous work (refs #4561) were incorporated.  Documentation is, sigh, still forthcoming.  Fixes #6814 and #3951 (with the new dispatch_uid argument to connect).   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@8223 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
