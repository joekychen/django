f | compiler.py | s | 47K | 1007 | Anssi Kääriäinen | akaariai@gmail.com | 1340723322 |  | Fixed #17485 -- Made defer work with select_related  This commit tackles a couple of issues. First, in certain cases there were some mixups if field.attname or field.name should be deferred. Field.attname is now always used.  Another issue tackled is a case where field is both deferred by .only(), and selected by select_related. This case is now an error.  A lot of thanks to koniiiik (Michal Petrucha) for the patch, and to Andrei Antoukh for review.

f | datastructures.py | s | 1.1K | 36 | Anssi Kääriäinen | akaariai@gmail.com | 1341152494 |  | Refactored the empty/full result logic in WhereNode.as_sql()  Made sure the WhereNode.as_sql() handles various EmptyResultSet and FullResultSet conditions correctly. Also, got rid of the FullResultSet exception class. It is now represented by '', [] return value in the as_sql() methods.
