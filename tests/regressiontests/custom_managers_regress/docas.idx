f | __init__.py | s | 0B | 0 | Malcolm Tredinnick | malcolm.tredinnick@gmail.com | 1237088493 |  | Use plain model.Manager, or suitable proxy, for model saving.  We can't use the default manager in Model.save_base(), since we need to retrieve existing objects which might be filtered out by that manager. We now always use a plain Manager instance at that point (or something that can replace it, such as a GeoManager), making all existing rows in the database visible to the saving code.  The logic for detecting a "suitable replacement" plain base is the same as for related fields: if the use_for_related_fields is set on the manager subclass, we can use it. The general requirement here is that we want a base class that returns the appropriate QuerySet subclass, but does not restrict the rows returned.  Fixed #8990, #9527.  Refs #2698 (which is not fixed by this change, but it's the first part of a larger change to fix that bug.)  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10056 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
