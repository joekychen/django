f | request_attrs.html | g | 153B |  | Gary Wilson Jr | gary.wilson@gmail.com | 1217793326 |  | Fixed #8092, #3828 -- Removed dictionary access for request objects so that GET and POST data doesn't "overwrite" request attributes when used in templates (since dictionary lookup is performed before attribute lookup).  This is backwards-incompatible if you were using the request object for dictionary access to the combined GET and POST data, but you should use `request.REQUEST` for that instead.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@8202 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
