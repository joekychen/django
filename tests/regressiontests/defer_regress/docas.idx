First, in certain cases there were some mixups if field.attname or field.name should be deferred. Field.attname is now always used.  Another issue tackled is a case where field is both deferred by .only(), and selected by select_related. This case is now an error.  A lot of thanks to koniiiik (Michal Petrucha) for the patch, and to Andrei Antoukh for review.
