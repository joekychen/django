Thanks, pressureman and kmtracey  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@17189 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37

Many thanks to Shai Berger for his work and persistence on this issue.  This is BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE for anyone relying on the current behavior that allows manually managed read-only transactions to be left dangling without a manual commit or rollback.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@15493 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
