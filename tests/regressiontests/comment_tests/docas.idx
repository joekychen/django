Much of this work was done by Thejaswi Puthraya as part of Google's Summer of Code project; much thanks to him for the work, and to them for the program.  This is a backwards-incompatible change; see the upgrading guide in docs/ref/contrib/comments/upgrade.txt for instructions if you were using the old comments system.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@8557 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37

f | urls_admin.py | s | 686B | 16 | Ramiro Morales | cramm0@gmail.com | 1315780576 |  | Fixed #14675 -- Completed removal of `from django.conf.urls.default import *` usage.  This applies to both our own [test] code and documentation examples. Also:  * Moved the functions and handlers from `django.conf.urls.defaults` up to    `django.conf.urls` deprecating the former module.  * Added documentation for `handler403`.  * Tweaked the URLs topic document a bit.  Thanks to pupeno and cdestigter for their great work contributing patches.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@16818 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
