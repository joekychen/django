Thanks to Leo for the test.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@12800 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37

This began life as (part of) James Bennett's comment-utils app, and was adapted to be part of Django by Thejaswi Puthraya and Jannis Leidel. Thanks, all!  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10122 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
