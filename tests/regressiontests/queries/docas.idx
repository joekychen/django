f | tests.py | s | 84K | 1817 | Anssi Kääriäinen | akaariai@gmail.com | 1341172355 |  | Fixed a regression introduced in where.as_sql() refactor  At least Oracle needs parentheses in negated where conditions, even if there is only single condition negated. Fixed this by reverting to old logic in that part of as_sql() and adding a comment about this.  I did not investigate why the parentheses are needed. The original offending commit was bd283aa844b04651b7c8b4e85f48c6dced1678f0.
