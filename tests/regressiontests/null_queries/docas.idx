f | models.py | s | 708B | 19 | Claude Paroz | claude@2xlibre.net | 1339085327 |  | Fixed #18269 -- Applied unicode_literals for Python 3 compatibility.  Thanks Vinay Sajip for the support of his django3 branch and Jannis Leidel for the review.

f | __init__.py | s | 0B | 0 | Russell Keith-Magee | russell@keith-magee.com | 1160794085 |  | Fixes #2737 -- Added code to allow None as a query value for __exact queries, raising an error otherwise. __exact=None is interpreted as the SQL 'value = NULL'. This fixes some minor problems with queries on unsaved objects with related object sets, and stops queries with a value of None being outright ignored (even if they reference an unknown attribute).   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@3902 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
