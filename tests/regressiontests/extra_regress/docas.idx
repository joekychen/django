Also added a section to the documentation to indicate why it's probably not a good idea to rely on this feature for complex stuff. Garbage in, garbage out applies even to Django code.  Thanks to erik for the test case for this one.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@7791 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
