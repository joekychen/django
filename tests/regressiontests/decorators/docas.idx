f | models.py | s | 34B | 1 | Gary Wilson Jr | gary.wilson@gmail.com | 1203919355 |  | Fixed #5701 -- Fixed decorators to take the name, attributes, and docstring of the function they decorate by adding a modified version of the `functools.wraps` function from Python 2.5.  `wraps` has been altered to work with Django's `curry` function and with Python 2.3, which doesn't allow assignment of a function's `__name__` attribute.  This fixes severaly annoyances, such as the online documentation for template filters served by the admin app.  This change is backwards incompatible if, for some reason, you were relying on the name of a Django decorator instead of the function it decorates.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@7153 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
