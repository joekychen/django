f | __init__.py | s | 23B | 1 | Malcolm Tredinnick | malcolm.tredinnick@gmail.com | 1237708709 |  | Fixed #5791 -- Added early-bailout support for views (ETags and Last-modified).  This provides support for views that can have their ETag and/or Last-modified values computed much more quickly than the view itself. Supports all HTTP verbs (not just GET).  Documentation and tests need a little more fleshing out (I'm not happy with the documentation at the moment, since it's a bit backwards), but the functionality is correct.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10114 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
