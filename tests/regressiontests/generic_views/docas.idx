This patch is the result of the work of many people, over many years. To try and thank individuals would inevitably lead to many people being left out or forgotten -- so rather than try to give a list that will inevitably be incomplete, I'd like to thank *everybody* who contributed in any way, big or small, with coding, testing, feedback and/or documentation over the multi-year process of getting this into trunk.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@14254 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
