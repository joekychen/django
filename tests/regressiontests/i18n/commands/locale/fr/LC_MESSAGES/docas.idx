This avoids problems with unintended automatic detection, marking and validation of Python string formatting specifiers performed by xgettext(1)/msgfmt(1) that stem from the fact that under the hood makemessages converts templates to Python code before passing them to xgettext.  This also makes it consistent with its behavior on literals passed to the blocktrans tag.  Thanks Jannis and claude for reviewing and feedback.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@17190 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
