f | __init__.py | s | 0B | 0 | Brian Rosner | brosner@gmail.com | 1216425274 |  | Merged the newforms-admin branch into trunk.  This is a backward incompatible change. The admin contrib app has been refactored. The newforms module has several improvements including FormSets and Media definitions.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@7967 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37

d | fixtures |  | 1 items |  | Jacob Kaplan-Moss | jacob@jacobian.org | 1232119951 |  | Cleaned up and refactored `ModelAdmin.formfield_for_dbfield`:    * The new method uses an admin configuration option (`formfield_overrides`); this makes custom admin widgets especially easy.   * Refactored what was left of `formfield_for_dbfield` into a handful of smaller methods so that it's easier to hook in and return custom fields where needed.   * These `formfield_for_*` methods now pass around `request` so that you can easily modify fields based on request (as in #3987).  Fixes #8306, #3987, #9148.  Thanks to James Bennet for the original patch; Alex Gaynor and Brian Rosner also contributed.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@9760 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
