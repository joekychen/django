Changed raise to conform to PEP 3109 and wrapped the long line. Added beginnings of tests for model fields.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@5778 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
f | 4x8.png | g | 87B |  | Gary Wilson Jr | gary.wilson@gmail.com | 1243489569 |  | Changes to `ImageFileDescriptor` and `ImageField` to fix a few cases of setting image dimension fields.  * Moved dimension field update logic out of `ImageFileDescriptor.__set__` and into its own method on `ImageField`.  * New `ImageField.update_dimension_fields` method is attached to model instance's `post_init` signal so that:    * Dimension fields are set when defined before the ImageField.    * Dimension fields are set when the field is assigned in the model constructor (fixes #11196), but only if the dimension fields don't already have values, so we avoid updating the dimensions every time an object is loaded from the database (fixes #11084).  * Clear dimension fields when the ImageField is set to None, which also causes dimension fields to be cleared when `ImageFieldFile.delete()` is used.  * Added many more tests for ImageField that test edge cases we weren't testing before, and moved the ImageField tests out of `file_storage` and into their own module within `model_fields`.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10858 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
