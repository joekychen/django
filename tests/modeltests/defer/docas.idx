First, in certain cases there were some mixups if field.attname or field.name should be deferred. Field.attname is now always used.  Another issue tackled is a case where field is both deferred by .only(), and selected by select_related. This case is now an error.  A lot of thanks to koniiiik (Michal Petrucha) for the patch, and to Andrei Antoukh for review.

In extreme cases, some fields are expensive to load from the database (e.g. GIS fields requiring conversion, or large text fields). This commit adds defer() and only() methods to querysets that allow the caller to specify which fields should not be loaded unless they are accessed.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10090 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
