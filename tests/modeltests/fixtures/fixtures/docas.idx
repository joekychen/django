f | invalid.json | g | 172B |  | Ramiro Morales | cramm0@gmail.com | 1318822147 |  | Tweaked test added in r16873 so it also works with Oracle.  * Changed invalid fixture from trying to insert a NULL value in a   null=False CharField to try with a DateTimeField instead because our   Oracle backend allows NULLs for CharFields than can be blank and that   insert wouldn't generate an error.  * cx_Oracle raises a   `DatabaseError: Could not load fixtures.Article(pk=1): ORA-01407: cannot update ("USER_DEFAULT"."FIXTURES_ARTICLE"."PUB_DATE") to NULL'`   instead of an IntegrityError like the rest of the DB-API drivers we   support, changed the error message we test for to start simply with   'Error' to catch both messages.    We might want to consider converting DatabaseError to IntegrityError   in the backend when the error code is ORA-1407.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@17002 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
