See the documentation for details.  This work started life as Brian Beck's "django-batchadmin." It was rewritten for inclusion in Django by Alex Gaynor, Jannis Leidel (jezdez), and Martin Mahner (bartTC). Thanks, guys!  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@10121 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
