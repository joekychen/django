f | INSTALL | g | 667B |  | Aymeric Augustin | aymeric.augustin@m4x.org | 1337069314 |  | Updated installation instructions.  Django 1.5 requires Python 2.6 or 2.7, and setup.py install over a previous installation doesn't work.
f | MANIFEST.in | g | 1.5K |  | Aymeric Augustin | aymeric.augustin@m4x.org | 1335722280 |  | Fixed #18023 -- Removed bundled simplejson.  And started the deprecation path for django.utils.simplejson.  Thanks Alex Ogier, Clueless, and other contributors for their work on the patch.
f | setup.py | s | 5.1K | 118 | Carl Meyer | carl@oddbird.net | 1337642938 |  | Fixed #18115 - added warning about overlaid install.  Setup.py now warns if it detects that Django is being installed over top of a previous installation that was never removed. This should only happen when installing with ``python setup.py install``, as pip automatically uninstalls before installing a new version and easy_install installs as an egg directory.  Also generally updated the installation doc.
f | README.rst | g | 1.7K |  | Jason Davies | jason@jasondavies.com | 1335644439 |  | Fix bullet formatting for README.rst.
f | LICENSE | g | 1.5K |  | Malcolm Tredinnick | malcolm.tredinnick@gmail.com | 1218292851 |  | Updated LICENSE file to acknowledge individual copyrights as well (after discussion with Jacob). This is a formality, since it was always true, just not noted.   git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@8258 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
f | setup.cfg | s | 108B | 3 | Russell Keith-Magee | russell@keith-magee.com | 1281013209 |  | Fixed #13153 -- Removed a stale reference to the examples directory in setup.cfg. Thanks to cesar@mifprojects.com for the report.  git-svn-id: http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk@13487 bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37
